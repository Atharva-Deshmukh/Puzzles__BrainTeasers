There are 100 lockers in a row, all initially closed. A person walks down the row and opens every locker. 
Then, another person walks down the row and closes every second locker (starting from the second locker). 
Next, a third person walks down the row and changes the state (opens it if it’s closed or closes it if it’s open) 
of every third locker (starting from the third locker). This continues until 100 people have walked down the row. 
At the end, which lockers are open?
- Each locker is toggled once for every divisor it has. For example, Locker 12 will be toggled by Person 1 
  (because 1 divides 12), Person 2 (because 2 divides 12), Person 3 (because 3 divides 12), Person 4, Person 6, 
  and Person 12.
  Since, initially, lockers were closed, so,
  Lockers are opened when toggled an odd number of times.
  Lockers are closed when toggled an even number of times.
  
  Most numbers have an even number of divisors. For example, 12 has divisors 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12, 
  which are 6 divisors (an even number). So, Locker 12 will end up being closed because it's toggled 
  an even number of times.
  
  However, perfect squares (like 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, etc.) have an odd number of divisors. 
  For instance, 16 has divisors 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16, but since 4 is repeated (it’s a square root of 16), 
  it only counts once, making the number of divisors odd. Hence, Locker 16 will be toggled an odd number 
  of times and will remain open.
  
  Final Answer: 
  Only lockers whose numbers are perfect squares will remain open. These lockers are:
  1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, and 100.


You are in a room with two doors. One door leads to certain death, and the other door leads to freedom. 
There are two guards, one in front of each door. One guard always tells the truth, and the other always lies. 
You don’t know which guard is which, and you don’t know which door leads to freedom. 
You can only ask a single question to one of the guards. What do you ask to find the door to freedom?

- Ask interviewer: does the guards know about each other?
