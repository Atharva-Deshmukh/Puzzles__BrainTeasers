Puzzle:
    There is a circle of N > 2 lights with a switch next to each of them. 
    Each switch can be flipped between two positions, thereby toggling the on/off states of three 
    lights: its own and the two lights adjacent to it. Initially, all the lights are off. 
    Design an algorithm for turning all the lights on by flipping the minimum number of switches. 

Ask the interviewer: 
- Is the switch physically present between the two bulbs?
  In that case, a single switch can toggle states of two bulbs only that are adjacent to it.

- Why the original puzzle says each switch toggles three lights:
  The original puzzle assumes a circular layout where each switch is associated with one bulb and 
  affects that bulb plus its two neighbors. This is a logical association, not necessarily a physical one. 
  The switch is conceptually tied to a bulb and its adjacent bulbs, not placed between bulbs.

 Solution: 
    Since all the lights are off initially, it is obvious that the final state of the lights depends 
    only on the parity(odd or even) of the number of times each switch is flipped and does not depend 
    on the order in which the switches are manipulated. 
    
    1 switch flip can light 3 bulbs.
    Assuming the lights are numbered from 1 to N in the clockwise order, we have two cases.

    N is divisible in 3:
    - 3 bulbs --> 1 switch flip lights all the bulbs 
    - 6 bulbs --> 2 switch flips lights all the bulbs (3 bulbs + 3 bulbs) --> N/3 flips
    - 9 bulbs --> 3 switch flips lights all the bulbs
    - 12 bulbs --> 4 switch flips lights all the bulbs

    N is NOT divisible in 3:
    - If we flip switch of (3k + 1)th bulb as above, then, at last there will be 
      one or two bulbs that will be still left off.
      And when we will flip one of the switches of these left off bulbs, then some of the existing on 
      lights will be turned off. So, best way will be to flip all the switches

    - 4 bulbs --> 4 switch flips lights all the bulbs 
    - 5 bulbs --> 5 switch flips lights all the bulbs  --> N flips
    - 7 bulbs --> 7 switch flips lights all the bulbs
    - 8 bulbs --> 8 switch flips lights all the bulbs
