- Cut a cake in 8 pieces in 3 cuts max:
	one horizontal and 2 verticles in crosses
	
- Whenever we cut diagonal corners of the chessboard, we cut equal color squares also.
- diagonally opposite corners of a 8 * 8 chessboard are of same color

- Number of Pieces that can be cut from a circle with n lines = 1 + (n*(n+1)/2)

- Any line that passes through the center of the rectangle divides the rectangle into two equal halves.

-  One year can have only one palindrome date as the year fixes the month and date too.

Puzzle:
	Given 10 identical bottles of identical pills (each bottle contains 100 pills).
	 Out of 10 bottles 9 have 1 gram of pills but 1 bottle has pills of the weight of 1.1 gram. 
	 Given a measurement scale, how would you find the heavy bottle? You can use the scale only once. 

Solution:
	- take, 1 pill from the first bottle, 2 pills from the second bottle, 3 pills from the third bottle...
	- In total, you'll be taking 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 10 pills. This is a mathematical sequence that adds 
	  up to 55 pills => (n * (n + 1))/2 = (10 x 11 / 2) when ALL PILLS WILL BE = 1g each	
	- if the weight shows 55.1 grams, the extra 0.1 gram comes from the first bottle 
	  (since you took 1 pill from it).
    - if the weight shows 55.2 grams, the second bottle has the heavier pills 
	  (because you took 2 pills from it).
    - if the weight shows 55.6 grams, the 6th bottle has the heavier pills 
	  (Since you too 6 pills from bottle 6)

Puzzle:
	Last Palindrome Date Before 10/02/2001  -> 2nd October 2001
	10/02/2001 -> "10022001"
	Format: MMDDYYYY 
	in YYYY => reverse(first two Y's) make day    --> max valid = 31
	           reverse(second two Y's) make month --> max valid = 12

Solution:
	- Since, each year has only one palindrome date, we won't get anything now in year 2001.
	  So, search before year 2001
	- Year 2000 => X since that will make day 00 -> NOT POSSIBLE
	- Year 1999 => X since that will make day 99 -> NOT POSSIBLE
	.
	. Year 1400 => X since that will make day 41 -> NOT POSSIBLE
	.
	. Year 1300 => Possible since that will make day 31 (valid day)
	. 1380 -> 08/31 -> valid date as 31st august in MMDD Format
	Hence last palindrome date = 08/31/1380

Puzzle:
	How can you represent days of month using two 6 sided dice? 
	You can write one number on each face of the dice from 0 to 9 and you have to represent days from 1 to 31, 
	for example for 1, one dice should show 0 and another should show 1, similarly for 29 one 
	dice should show 2 and another should show 9. 

Solution:

	0 will be on both sides to represent 01 and 10..

    1 will repeat for 11
    2 will repeat for 22

    we need (0, 1, 2) on both dice
	we need 3 on just one dice
	Onde dice need all the numbers here from 0-9 to represent 10-19..
	Other dice needs only 0, 1, 2 

	But we have only 6+6 sides on both dice
	Here we get (0, 1, 2) + (0-9)
                    3 + 10

	1 extra side can be saved by reusing 9 as 6 and vice-versa


	Dice1: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
	Dice2: 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8
