Puzzle:
You’re in a car with a helium balloon on a string that is tied to the floor. 
The windows are closed. When you step on the accelerator, what happens to the 
balloon—does it move forward, move backward, or stay put?

Ask interviewer: wrt ground OR wrt me sitting in backside

Solution:
The correct answer is: Forward.

Here's the explanation:
This puzzle is a great test of intuition about physics, especially fluid dynamics and 
buoyancy.

Setup:
You're in a closed car.
There's a helium balloon tied to the floor.
Helium is lighter than air, so the balloon floats.
The car is stationary, and then you accelerate forward.
What happens when the car accelerates?
When the car accelerates forward:

The air inside the car is pushed backward due to inertia (just like you feel pushed 
back into your seat).This creates a higher air pressure at the back of the car and 
lower pressure at the front.Now, because helium is lighter than air, the balloon 
behaves opposite to how heavier objects behave:

Heavier objects (like you) are pushed backward.
But the balloon, being buoyant, is pushed forward, toward the lower pressure area.
So: Balloon moves forward when the car accelerates.

Puzzle:
A Bear has fallen from a height of 10m from ground. It reached ground in sqrt(2) seconds. 
Luckily it didn’t get hurt. What color is the bear?

Just output the color. For example, following are acceptable answers.
	White
	Black
	Pink
	Brown
	Yellow
	Red
	Blue
	Green

Solution:

White

This puzzle is a classic riddle that plays on physics and geography. 
Here's the reasoning:

The bear falls from a height of 10 meters and reaches the ground in √2 seconds.
Using the physics formula for free fall:
h = (g * (t) ^2) / 2 => half gt square

Plugging in the values:
​
g = 10 m/s², which is not the standard gravitational acceleration on Earth 
(which is approximately 9.8 m/s²), but exactly 10 m/s².
This value of gravitational acceleration is only found near the poles, 
and more precisely, at the North Pole.

The only species of bear found at the North Pole is the polar bear, 
which is white in color.

So, the answer is: White.


Puzzle:
      Can 2 persons be with same number of hairs on their heads?
	  One day Ram and Shyam were searching Google for finding what is the maximum number of hairs 
	  on the human head. They found that it is 2, 00, 000. Then Shyam thought a while and suddenly 
	  made a statement that there are at least two Bengaluru citizens who have got the exact same 
	  number of hairs on their heads. Both of them knew the fact that the population of Bengaluru 
	  is 1.23 crores. But Ram was still thinking whether Shyam's statement is correct or not. 
	  Is Shyam's statement 100% correct or we need more information to deduce the truth of the statement?

Solution:
      This problem and solution are based on 'Pigeonhole principle'. There is nothing related 
	  to probability in this and Shyam's statement is 100% correct!

	  PRINCIPLE:
	  If n items are distributed among m containers and n > m, then at least one container 
	  must contain more than one item.

Puzzle:
	Given 10 identical bottles of identical pills (each bottle contains 100 pills).
	 Out of 10 bottles 9 have 1 gram of pills but 1 bottle has pills of the weight of 1.1 gram. 
	 Given a measurement scale, how would you find the heavy bottle? You can use the scale only once. 

Solution:
	- take, 1 pill from the first bottle, 2 pills from the second bottle, 3 pills from the third bottle...
	- In total, you'll be taking 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 10 pills. This is a mathematical sequence that adds 
	  up to 55 pills => (n * (n + 1))/2 = (10 x 11 / 2) when ALL PILLS WILL BE = 1g each	
	- if the weight shows 55.1 grams, the extra 0.1 gram comes from the first bottle 
	  (since you took 1 pill from it).
    - if the weight shows 55.2 grams, the second bottle has the heavier pills 
	  (because you took 2 pills from it).
    - if the weight shows 55.6 grams, the 6th bottle has the heavier pills 
	  (Since you too 6 pills from bottle 6)

Puzzle:
	Last Palindrome Date Before 10/02/2001  -> 2nd October 2001
	10/02/2001 -> "10022001"
	Format: MMDDYYYY 
	in YYYY => reverse(first two Y's) make day    --> max valid = 31
	           reverse(second two Y's) make month --> max valid = 12

Solution:
	- Since, each year has only one palindrome date, we won't get anything now in year 2001.
	  So, search before year 2001
	- Year 2000 => X since that will make day 00 -> NOT POSSIBLE
	- Year 1999 => X since that will make day 99 -> NOT POSSIBLE
	.
	. Year 1400 => X since that will make day 41 -> NOT POSSIBLE
	.
	. Year 1300 => Possible since that will make day 31 (valid day)
	. 1380 -> 08/31 -> valid date as 31st august in MMDD Format
	Hence last palindrome date = 08/31/1380

Puzzle:
	How can you represent days of month using two 6 sided dice? 
	You can write one number on each face of the dice from 0 to 9 and you have to represent days from 1 to 31, 
	for example for 1, one dice should show 0 and another should show 1, similarly for 29 one 
	dice should show 2 and another should show 9. 

Solution:

	0 will be on both sides to represent 01 and 10..

    1 will repeat for 11
    2 will repeat for 22

    we need (0, 1, 2) on both dice
	we need 3 on just one dice
	Onde dice need all the numbers here from 0-9 to represent 10-19..
	Other dice needs only 0, 1, 2 

	But we have only 6+6 sides on both dice
	Here we get (0, 1, 2) + (0-9)
                    3 + 10

	1 extra side can be saved by reusing 9 as 6 and vice-versa


	Dice1: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
	Dice2: 0, 1, 2, 6, 7, 8

Puzzle:
	Weight of Heavy Ball
	There are 2187 balls, out of which 1 is heavy. Find the minimum number of attempts the 
	balls have to be weighed for finding out the heavy ball.

Solution: 
	The minimum amount of measurements needed to be done will be equal to 7 times. 2187 = 3^7 = (729 * 3)
	Make 3 groups of 729 each
	G1 - 729
	G2 - 729
	G3 - 729

	Now weigh groups in combinations

    												STEP-1
													------
	if(G1 == G2) ==> G3 has heaviest ball       
	if(G1  > G2) ==> G1 has heaviest ball       
	if(G1  < G2) ==> G2 has heaviest ball  

	So, we get the group where the heaviest ball lies, let it be G1

	    											STEP-2
													------

	Now, divide G1 into 3 groups of 243 balls each
	G1 - 243
	G2 - 243
	G3 - 243

	if(G1 == G2) ==> G3 has heaviest ball       
	if(G1  > G2) ==> G1 has heaviest ball       
	if(G1  < G2) ==> G2 has heaviest ball

	So, we get the group where the heaviest ball lies, let it be G1

	    											STEP-3
													------

	Now, divide G1 into 3 groups of 81 balls each
	G1 - 81
	G2 - 81
	G3 - 81

	if(G1 == G2) ==> G3 has heaviest ball       
	if(G1  > G2) ==> G1 has heaviest ball       
	if(G1  < G2) ==> G2 has heaviest ball

	So, we get the group where the heaviest ball lies, let it be G1

	    											STEP-4
													------

	Now, divide G1 into 3 groups of 27 balls each
	G1 - 27
	G2 - 27
	G3 - 27

	if(G1 == G2) ==> G3 has heaviest ball       
	if(G1  > G2) ==> G1 has heaviest ball       
	if(G1  < G2) ==> G2 has heaviest ball

	So, we get the group where the heaviest ball lies, let it be G1

	    											STEP-5
													------

	Now, divide G1 into 3 groups of 9 balls each
	G1 - 9
	G2 - 9
	G3 - 9

	if(G1 == G2) ==> G3 has heaviest ball       
	if(G1  > G2) ==> G1 has heaviest ball       
	if(G1  < G2) ==> G2 has heaviest ball

	So, we get the group where the heaviest ball lies, let it be G1

	    											STEP-6
													------

	Now, divide G1 into 3 groups of 3 balls each
	G1 - 3
	G2 - 3
	G3 - 3

	if(G1 == G2) ==> G3 has heaviest ball       
	if(G1  > G2) ==> G1 has heaviest ball       
	if(G1  < G2) ==> G2 has heaviest ball

	So, we get the group where the heaviest ball lies, let it be G1

	    											STEP-7
													------

	Now, divide G1 into 3 groups of 1 balls each
	G1 - 1
	G2 - 1
	G3 - 1

	if(G1 == G2) ==> G3 has heaviest ball       
	if(G1  > G2) ==> G1 has heaviest ball       
	if(G1  < G2) ==> G2 has heaviest ball

	So, we Finally get the heaviest ball!
